            Well, oh, they might wear classic Reeboks <br>  
            Or knackered Converse <br>  
            Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks <br>  
            But all of that's what the point is not <br>  
            The point's that there ain't no romance around there <br>

            And there's the truth that they can't see <br>
            They'd probably like to throw a punch at me <br>
            And if you could only see 'em, then you would agree <br>
            Agree that there ain't no romance around there <br>

            You know? <br>
            Oh, it's a funny thing, you know? <br>
            We'll tell 'em if you like <br>
            We'll tell 'em all tonight, they'll never listen <br>
            Because their minds are made up <br>
            And course it's all okay to carry on that way <br>
        </p>

            'Cause over there there's broken bones <br>
            There's only music <br>
            So that there's new ringtones <br>
            And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes <br>
            To see it's a little different around here <br>

            Don't get me wrong oh, there's boys in bands <br>
            And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands <br>
            And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans <br>
            He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead <br>
        </p>

            Don't you know? <br>
            Oh, it's a funny thing, you know <br>
            We'll tell 'em if you like <br>
            We'll tell 'em all tonight, they'll never listen <br>
            Because their minds are made up <br>
            And course it's all okay to carry on that way <br>

            But I said no, oh, no <br>
            Well, you won't get me to go <br>
            Not anywhere, not anywhere <br>
            No, I won't go <br>
            Oh, no, no <br>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="normal">
        <p>
            But over there there's friends of mine <br>
            What can I say? I've known 'em for a long, long time <br>
            And they might overstep the line <br>
            But you just cannot get angry in the same way <br>

            No, not in the same way <br>
            Said not in the same way <br>
            Oh, no <br>
            Oh, no, no <br>
        </p>
